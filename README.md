# Muddhapappu Avakaya Recipe Website  

This is a fun and practice project where I created a simple webpage to showcase the recipe for **Muddhapappu Avakaya**, a classic Andhra delicacy. The purpose of this project is to learn and practice HTML and CSS while building a small, meaningful project.

## Features  
- Detailed recipe with ingredients and preparation steps.  
- Easy-to-follow instructions on how to enjoy the dish.  
- Useful tips for enhancing the experience.  
- A clean, styled layout with HTML and CSS for better presentation.  

## Why I Made This  
This website was created purely for fun and to practice web development skills as I learn more about HTML and CSS. It's not meant to be a professional project, but a way to apply what Iâ€™ve learned and improve my skills.

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: To structure the content.  
- **CSS**: To style the page and make it visually appealing.  

## How to Use  
1. Open the `index.html` file in any browser.
